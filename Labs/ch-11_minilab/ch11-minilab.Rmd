# Introduction

MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) is very versatile and can be framed to solve many different statistical problems (especially once we include categorical variables).

There are a number of theorems that we will prove and they all require algebraic manipulation using some basic matrix theory.

You will apply some of the matrix results in this mini lab.

# Matrix results and definitions

There are not many we need -- the main ones for now are:

>
    1. $(AB)^{'} =B^{'} A^{'}$
    2. $( A^{-1} )^{'} = ( A^{'} )^{-1}$
    3. If $M$ is idempotent then $MM=M$
    4. Square matrix $A$ is symmetric if and only if $A^{'}=A$
    
    
# Application

## The projection matrix $H$

Also known as the hat matrix.

$$H=X(X^{'}X)^{-1}X^{'}$$

##Questions

Using Latex show the following to be true:


>
    1. $H$ is symmetric
    2. $(I-H)$ is symmetric
    3. $H$ is idempotent
    4. $(I-H)$ is idempotent
    5. $HX=X$
    6. $H(I-H)=0$
