abstract: This project is all about analysing tables. You can choose data from Chapter 9. Specifically you must choose data that results in a 2 way table. Give a summary of the analysis here once you have completed the rest.

# Introduction to the data
Give a detailed talk about the data and the objective of your study.



## Data and variables(see MS pg. 459 etc)
Describe the data and the problem we wish to investigate. Make sure you give the table or tables you wish to analyze.

## Make plots and summaries
This will further help in describing the data and the problem you wish to solve

# Describe the theory you will use

Use $\LaTeX$ and give the relevant equations with descriptions.

Latex Example: See (http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#elements-of-math-mode)


You must make at least 3 quotes from literature using bibtex.
Example: [@millar] shows how to use classical methods etc.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
P(|X-\mu| > k) & = & P(|X-\mu|^2 > k^2)\\
& \leq & \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[|X-\mu|^2\right]}{k^2}\\
& \leq & \frac{\mathrm{Var}[X]}{k^2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

# Check assumptions


# Make plots

These will be used in solving the problem at hand -- use `library(s20x)` or any other packages useful.

# Conclusion
